==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emertechie/express-local-auth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emertechie/express-local-auth)

Express middleware to implement username/email/password authentication including registration and password management

Early days, so docs to come. For now, have a look at the bare-bones html sample app which shows basic configuration using sessions (In theory, library supports session-less use also). Plenty of tests as well.
